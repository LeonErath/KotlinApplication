### A little App to Learn the Basics of the new Programming Language Kotlin

I've programmed an App, where I can see all upcoming Movies. I can store Movies that I like in a separate Watchlist. The reason for programming this App is to learn the new language Kotlin. I'm hoping to get a better understanding of its functions and why everybody loves kotlin. I will publish now and then new updates.

## Update 13.06.2017

Cleaned my Code. I'm still making many mistakes when it comes to Kotlins syntax. Hope I will get used to not using semicolons or not using getter/setter methods. Additionally added some logic to my database. Added the relationship between movies and lists. I could delete some of the boilerplate code because of this.
